_**Vibeduck**_ is an experimental open-source command-line tool designed to assist with coding tasks by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows developers to interact with an AI in a chat-like interface directly from their terminal. The AI can understand requests and use a defined set of tools to interact with the local filesystem, such as reading, creating, or patching files.

**Features (conceptual):**

*   Interactive chat interface for communicating with an LLM.
*   Extensible tool system allowing the LLM to perform actions (e.g., file, git operations).
*   Symfony Console based for a robust CLI experience.

**Disclaimer:**

This is an **experimental project** developed in collaboration with an LLM (AI assistant). It is intended for exploration and demonstration purposes. Use with caution, especially when granting tools access to modify your filesystem.

**Note:** The project structure and some functionalities were co-designed and co-implemented with an AI.
